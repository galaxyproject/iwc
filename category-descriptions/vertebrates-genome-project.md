A comprehensive suite of genomic workflows developed for generating reference-quality vertebrate genome sequences. The framework features specialized methods for high-quality genome assembly, haplotype phasing, and chromosome-scale scaffolding. The VGP pipeline offers flexible assembly trajectories based on available data types (PacBio HiFi solo, trio with parental Illumina, or HiFi with HiC phasing) with optional scaffolding using Bionano optical maps and/or Hi-C data.

The complete workflow encompasses quality control, parameter estimation, contig assembly, purging of duplications, scaffolding, decontamination, and mitogenome assemblyâ€”all optimized within the Galaxy workflow management system. A detailed tutorial is available for guidance on workflow parameters and result interpretation.
