Mass spectrometry-based workflows for comprehensive small molecule analysis and metabolite profiling.
These include preprocessing pipelines for LC-MS and GC-MS data using XCMS, molecular formula assignment
with MFAssignR, metabolite identification and annotation, and untargeted metabolomics analysis protocols
for biomarker discovery and pathway analysis.
