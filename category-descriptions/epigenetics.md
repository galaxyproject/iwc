Analytical workflows for processing and interpreting epigenomic sequencing data. These include protocols
for ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility analysis, ChIP-seq transcription factor binding site identification,
and Cut&Run experiments, with emphasis on peak calling and regulatory element annotation.
