## About the IWC

The Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC) curates and maintains a collection of high-quality Galaxy workflows for the scientific community. Our mission is to provide researchers with reliable, tested, and well-documented workflows for diverse analytical tasks.

## Workflow Collection

Workflows are organized by scientific domain in the [workflows](workflows/) directory and publicly available through:
- [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc)
- [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=IWC#workflows)

Every workflow in our collection undergoes:
- Rigorous peer review
- Automated testing before publication and with each Galaxy release
- Validation against [Galaxy best practices](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices_workflows.html)
- Semantic versioning via GitHub releases

Each workflow includes comprehensive metadata:
- License information
- Author attribution
- Institutional affiliations

The IWC continuously develops resources for workflow creators, including best practices guides, technical tips, troubleshooting FAQs, and community assistance for developing high-quality Galaxy workflows.
