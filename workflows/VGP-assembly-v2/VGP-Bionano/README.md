# VGP Workflow #3

This workflow scaffolds contigs generated from Hifiasm using Bionano optical maps to improve assembly contiguity. Bionano maps are generated from labelling ultra-long DNA at specific motifs, and this data is used to generate a hybrid scaffold assembly with the HiFi assembly contigs. This scaffolding results in sized gaps. 

## VGP Assembly Pipeline

The collaboration between the [VGP](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) has led to the creation of a set of workflows dedicated to high-quality genome assembly with long reads. The pipeline includes the following workflows:
-   Creation of k-mer count databases and histograms with Meryl
-   HiFi long read assembly with Hifiasm (three modes available: pseudohaplotype, HiC-phased, and trio)
-   Scaffolding with Bionano optical map data (optional)
-   Scaffolding with HiC data

### Inputs

-   Bionano mapping data in CMAP format
-   Assembly in fasta format, generated by workflow `VGP #2: Long read assembly with hifiasm`
-   Estimated genome size parameter file, generated by workflow `VGP #2: Long read assembly with hifiasm`


### Outputs

-   Bionano hybrid scaffold outputs
    -   Scaffolded contigs
    -   Non scaffolded contigs
    -   All contigs (scaffolded + non-scaffolded contigs)
        -   this is what is used for downstream scaffolding!
