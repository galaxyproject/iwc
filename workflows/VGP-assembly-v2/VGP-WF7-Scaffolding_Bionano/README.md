# VGP Workflow #3

This workflow produces a hybrid scaffolding based on a phased assembly and Bionano genomic mapping data.

## VGP Pipeline

The Collaboration between the [VGP](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) lead to the creation of a set of workflows dedicated to hybrid genome assembly. The pipeline inclide de following workflows:
-   Creation of kmer count histograms with Meryl
-   Hifi Long Read phased assembly with Hifiasm
-   Scaffolding with Bionano Mapping data (Optional)
-   Scaffolding with HiC data


### Inputs

-   Bionano mapping data in cmap format.
-   Phased assembly in fasta format (Output of the workflow VGP #2 : Phased assembly)
-   A parameter file containing the estimated genome length generated by the workflow VGP #2 : Phased assembly


### Outputs

-   Bionano hybrid Scaffolds
    -   Scaffolded
    -   Non scaffolded
    -   All scaffolds
-   Quast Quality Control
    -   Tabular report
    -   HTML report
    -   PDF report
