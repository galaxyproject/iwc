# Contiging Solo w/HiC:

Generate phased assembly based on PacBio Hifi Reads using HiC data from the same individual for phasing.

## Inputs

1. Hifi long reads [fastq]
2. Collection of Hi-C forward reads [fastq]
3. Collection of Hi-C reverse reads [fastq]
4. K-mer database [meryldb]
5. Genome profile summary generated by Genomescope [txt]
6. Name of first assembly
7. Name of second assembly

## Outputs

1. Haplotype 1 assembly ([fasta] and [gfa])
2. Haplotype 2 assembly ([fasta] and [gfa])
3. Trimmed Hi-C forward reads collection
4. Trimmed Hi-C reverse reads collection
5. QC: BUSCO report for both assemblies
6. QC: Merqury report for both assemblies
7. QC: Assembly statistics for both assemblies
8. QC: Nx plot for both assemblies
9. QC: Size plot for both assemblies
