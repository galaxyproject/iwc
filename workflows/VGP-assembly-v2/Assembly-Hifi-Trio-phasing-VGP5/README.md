# Assembly with Hifi reads and Trio Data

Generate phased assembly based on PacBio Hifi Reads using parental Illumina data for phasing

## Inputs

1. Hifi long reads [fastq]
2. Concatenated Illumina reads : Paternal [fastq]
3. Concatenated Illumina reads : Maternal [fastq]
4. K-mer database [meryldb]
5. Paternal hapmer database [meryldb]
6. Maternal hapmer database [meryldb]
7. Genome profile summary generated by Genomescope [txt]
8. Genome model parameters generated by Genomescope [tabular]
9. Homozygous read coverage (Estimated from the Genomescope model if not provided)
10. Lineage of the species being assembled
11. Bloom Filter
12. Name of first haplotype
13. Name of second haplotype

## Outputs

1. Haplotype 1 assembly
2. Haplotype 2 assembly
3. QC: BUSCO report for both assemblies
4. Merqury report for both assemblies
5. Assembly statistics for both assemblies
6. Nx Plot for both assemblies
7. Size plot for both assemblies
