# Assembly with Hifi reads and Trio Data

Generate phased assembly based on PacBio Hifi Reads using parental Illumina data for phasing

## Inputs

1. Hifi long reads [fastq]
2. Concatenated Illumina reads : Paternal [fastq]
3. Concatenated Illumina reads : Maternal [fastq]
4. K-mer database [meryldb]
5. Paternal hapmer database [meryldb]
6. Maternal hapmer database [meryldb]
7. Genome profile summary generated by Genomescope [txt]
8. Bloom Filter
9. Name of first haplotype
10. Name of second haplotype

## Outputs

1. Haplotype 1 assembly
2. Haplotype 2 assembly
3. QC: BUSCO report for both assemblies
4. Merqury report for both assemblies
5. Assembly statistics for both assemblies
6. Nx Plot for both assemblies
7. Size plot for both assemblies
