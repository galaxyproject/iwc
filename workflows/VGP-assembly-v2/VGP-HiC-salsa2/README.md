# VGP Workflow #4

This workflow produces a hybrid scaffolding based on a phased assembly and HiC mapping data.

## VGP Pipeline

The Collaboration between the [VGP](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) lead to the creation of a set of workflows dedicated to hybrid genome assembly. The pipeline inclide de following workflows:
-   Creation of kmer count histograms with Meryl
-   Hifi Long Read phased assembly with Hifiasm
-   Scaffolding with Bionano Mapping data (Optional)
-   Scaffolding with HiC data


### Inputs

-   HiC reads :
    -   Forward reads (If the analysis is run on several files, concatenate forward reads in the same order than reverse reads)
    -   Reverse reads (If the analysis is run on several files, concatenate reverse reads in the same order than dorward reads)
-   Phased assembly in fasta format (Output of the workflow VGP #2 : Phased assembly) or Scaffolded assembly in fasta format (Output of the workflow VGP #3 : Bionano scaffolding)
-   A parameter file containing the estimated genome length generated by the workflow VGP #2 : Phased assembly
-   Lineage of the organism to use for Busco search

### Outputs

-   Contact heatmap before Scaffolding
-   Contact heatmap after Scaffolding
-   Salsa hybrid Scaffolds
    -   Scaffolded assembly
