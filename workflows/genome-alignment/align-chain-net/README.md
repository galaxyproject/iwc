# Genome align, chain, and net workflow with KegAlign, lastz, and UCSC tools

This workflow is designed for alignment of two large (e.g. mammalian) genomes with expected divergence ranging from 1 to 40%. It uses a GPU-accelerated version of lastz (KegAlign) -- this means a machine with a GPU is required for the step with the KegAlign tool.
