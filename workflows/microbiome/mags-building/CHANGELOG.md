# Changelog

## [0.4] - 2025-10-07

### Logic Update

* **metaSPAdes** now supports running in single-assembly mode when individual samples are submitted. Previously, it always performed co-assembly, which is the default tool setting.
* Grouping for grouped assemblies is now handled in the main workflow through a metadata sample sheet (`Metadata for grouped assembly/binning`). If no sample sheet is provided, individual assemblies are performed by default.
* All tools have been updated to their latest versions.
