# Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) Generation  

This workflow generates Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from paired short reads.  
Dereplicated MAGs for the complete input sample set are reported.

## Workflow Logic  

The workflow supports assembly using **metaSPADES** and **MEGAHIT**.  
For binning, it utilizes four different tools: **MetaBAT2, MaxBin2, SemiBin, and CONCOCT**. The resulting bins are then refined using **Binette**, the successor of metaWRAP.  

## MAGs Annotation and Quality Control  

After binning, the resulting MAGs are **dereplicated** across all input samples based on **CheckM2 quality metrics** using **dRep**. The following processing steps are then performed:  

- **Annotation** with Bakta  
- **Taxonomic Assignment** using GTDB-Tk  
- **Quality Control** via QUAST and CheckM/CheckM2  
- **Abundance Estimation** per sample with CoverM  

All results are consolidated into a single **MultiQC report** for easy analysis.  

## Input Requirements  

Input reads must be quality-filtered, with host reads removed. 

- **Trimmed reads**: Quality-trimmed reads from individual samples.
- **Metadata for grouped assembly/binning**: A two-column, tab-separated metadata file. The first column should contain the sample names matching those in the **Trimmed reads** input, and the second column should specify the group indicating how samples are to be grouped for assembly and binning. If no file is provided, individual assemblies are performed. To perform a full co-assembly, assign all samples to the same group.

> **Note**: Merging reads can result in large input files, significantly increasing computational demandsâ€”especially during assembly and binning, which may require substantial RAM. Our tests with synthetic samples up to **50 GB** showed feasible performance. For larger datasets, we recommend limiting the approach to **individual or pooled MAGs generation**.
