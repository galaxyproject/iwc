# **Metagenomic Taxonomic Profiling Workflow**

This workflow performs taxonomic profiling of shotgun metagenomic data using multiple classification approaches and enables harmonized comparison across tools.

It is designed to support exploratory and comparative analyses by integrating taxonomic profiles generated with different algorithms and reference databases.

## **Inputs**
- Quality-controlled paired-end FASTQ files
- Host-derived reads removed **if applicable** (only required when samples contain host DNA)

---

## **Outputs**
- Taxonomic profiles generated by multiple profiling tools
- Harmonized taxonomy tables suitable for cross-tool comparison
- Interactive Krona plots

## **Workflow Steps**

### 1. Taxonomic Profiling
- Kraken2 + Bracken  
- MetaPhlAn  
- SYLPh  

### 2. Taxonomy Harmonization & Visualization
- Taxpasta  
  - Normalizes and harmonizes taxonomic profiles across tools to enable direct comparison
- Krona
