# Protein-ligand complex parameterization

Parameterizes an input protein (PDB) and ligand (SDF) file prior to molecular
dynamics simulation with GROMACS.

This is a simple workflow intended for use as a subworkflow in more complex
MD workflows. It is used as a subworkflow by the GROMACS MMGBSA and dcTMD
workflows.
