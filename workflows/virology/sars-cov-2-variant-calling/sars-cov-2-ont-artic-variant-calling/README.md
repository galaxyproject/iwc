COVID-19: variation analysis on ARTIC ONT data
----------------------------------------------

This workflow for ONT-sequenced ARTIC data is modeled after the alignment/variant-calling steps of the [ARTIC pipeline](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It performs, essentially, the same steps as that pipelineâ€™s minion command, i.e. read mapping with minimap2 and variant calling with medaka. Like the Illumina ARTIC workflow it uses ivar for primer trimming. Since ONT-sequenced reads have a much higher error rate than Illumina-sequenced reads and are therefor plagued more by false-positive variant calls, this workflow does make no attempt to handle amplicons affected by potential primer-binding site mutations.
