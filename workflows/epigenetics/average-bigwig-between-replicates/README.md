# Average BigWig Between Replicates

## Overview

This utility workflow automates the process of generating consensus coverage tracks from biological replicates. It calculates the average signal across multiple replicates of the same biological condition, producing a single representative BigWig file for each experimental condition that improves signal-to-noise ratio and facilitates visualization and downstream analysis.

## Workflow Process

The Average-BigWig-Between-Replicates workflow provides:

1. **Intelligent Sample Organization**
   - Automatically groups replicates based on sample naming patterns
   - Processes collections of BigWig files with structured naming conventions
   - Organizes files hierarchically by experimental condition
   - Supports flexible naming patterns with sample and replicate identifiers

2. **Signal Averaging with Customizable Resolution**
   - Computes mean signal values across replicates at each genomic position
   - Provides adjustable bin size for controlling output resolution
   - Optimizes performance and file size based on experimental needs
   - Maintains signal integrity while reducing noise from individual replicates

3. **Standardized Output Generation**
   - Produces a collection of averaged BigWig files organized by sample
   - Maintains metadata and chromosome information from input files
   - Generates files compatible with genome browsers and downstream tools
   - Streamlines visualization of experimental conditions

## Input Requirements

**BigWig Collection**
- A collection of normalized BigWig files with structured identifiers
- Naming convention: `sample_identifier_replicate_identifier`
- Example: `treatment1_rep1`, `treatment1_rep2`, `control_rep1`, `control_rep2`

**Parameters**
- `bin_size`: Controls resolution of output files
  - Smaller values (e.g., 5bp): Higher resolution, larger files, longer processing time
  - Larger values (e.g., 50bp): Lower resolution, smaller files, faster processing
  - Recommended settings: 5bp for RNA-seq, 50bp for ChIP-seq and similar applications

## Applications

This workflow is essential for:
- Generating consensus tracks for genome browser visualization
- Reducing noise in epigenomic and transcriptomic signal data
- Preparing input files for peak calling and differential binding analysis
- Creating publication-quality genome browser screenshots
- Standardizing analysis across multiple replicates in multi-sample experiments
