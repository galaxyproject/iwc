# Parallel Accession Download

## Overview

This workflow implements a highly optimized system for retrieving sequencing data from public repositories in parallel. By creating independent download jobs for each accession number, it achieves significantly faster and more reliable data acquisition compared to sequential approaches, making it ideal for large-scale data collection projects.

## Workflow Process

The parallel-accession-download workflow provides:

1. **Accession Processing and Job Creation**
   - Parses a text file containing sequencing run accessions (SRA, ENA, etc.)
   - Creates independent download jobs for each accession
   - Distributes workload across available computational resources
   - Implements robust error handling for individual download failures
   - Maintains overall workflow progress despite individual job failures

2. **Optimized Data Retrieval**
   - Utilizes fasterq-dump for high-performance data acquisition
   - Applies appropriate compression settings for efficient storage
   - Handles both single-end and paired-end sequencing data formats
   - Respects repository access policies and rate limits
   - Implements connection retry logic for unstable network conditions

3. **Output Organization and Validation**
   - Collects downloaded files into appropriate Galaxy collections
   - Organizes single-end and paired-end reads separately
   - Validates downloaded data integrity
   - Provides clear reporting of successful and failed downloads
   - Enables downstream analysis with properly structured data collections

## Input Requirements

**Required Input:**
- **Run accessions** [TXT] - A text file containing one sequencing run accession per line
  - Supports SRA accessions (SRR, ERR, DRR)
  - Compatible with other repository formats
  - Allows mixed accession types within the same input file

## Output Details

The workflow produces:
- **Single End Reads** - Collection of FASTQ files for single-end sequencing runs
- **Paired End Reads** - Paired collection of FASTQ files for paired-end sequencing runs

Each output collection is organized by accession ID for easy reference and downstream processing.

## Applications

This parallel download workflow is essential for:
- Retrieving large datasets from public repositories
- Creating reproducible analysis collections from published studies
- Building reference datasets for benchmarking
- Efficient acquisition of data for meta-analyses
- Classroom and workshop preparation involving multiple datasets
- Any project requiring retrieval of multiple sequencing run accessions

## Performance Advantages

The parallel architecture provides significant advantages over sequential approaches:
- Downloads multiple accessions simultaneously rather than one-by-one
- Continues overall progress even if individual downloads fail
- Scales efficiently with available computational resources
- Reduces total download time by orders of magnitude for large collections
- Improves robustness through isolated job execution
